Learning and exploring the Insomnia REST Client <https://github.com/Kong/insomnia>.

## Description

The [Insomnia REST Client](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia), usually referred to as just *Insomnia*, is an
overwhelmingly popular developer tool. And rightly so, because it's feature-ful, fluid, and Open Source. This project is
my way of exploring some of the features of Insomnia, like exporting collections and making a plugin.

## Sub-projects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via sub-projects:

### `export/`

Export Insomnia collections data from the embedded [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) database.

See the README in [export/](export/).

### `plugin/`

A "hello world" Insomnia plugin.

See the README in [plugin/](plugin/).

## Wish List

General clean-ups, changes and things I wish to implement for this project:

* DONE sequester the original exporting-related code and notes to a "export/" directory
* DONE Create a "hello world" Insomnia plugin.

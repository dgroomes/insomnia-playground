Learning and exploring the Insomnia REST Client <https://github.com/Kong/insomnia>.

## Description

The [Insomnia REST Client](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia), usually referred to as just *Insomnia*, is an
overwhelmingly popular developer tool. And rightly so, because it's feature-ful, fluid, and Open Source. This project is
my way of exploring some of the features of Insomnia, like exporting collections and making a plugin.

## Wish List

General clean-ups, changes and things I wish to implement for this project:

* DONE sequester the original exporting-related code and notes to a "export/" directory
* Create a "hello world" Insomnia plugin.
